<h1> model experiment biology</h1>

A simulation for an experiment, what we have done in biology class

It's trying to simulate the evolutionary development of beetles.

how it works:

At the beginning are 10 beetles of every color in the habitat.<br>
Then we pick one individual beetle from the 40.<br>
We throw than a die to decide what should happen with this beetle.<br>
<h3>**actions by roll result**</h3>

| <h2>roll| <h2>action| 
| ------------ |:-------------:| 
| 1 or 2| picked beetle dies | 
| 3 | picked beetle dies <br> when it is not green |   
| 4 | picked beetle dies <br> when it is not <br>green or brown | 
| 5 | picked beetle dies <br> when it is not <br> green, brown or red |
| 6 | every beetle lives | 

If the beetle dies, then we pick another beetle and from his kind, we put a new one of its kind in the habitat/simulation.
